% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}

Signatures of outflowing gas have been observed in a number of low-mass X-ray binaries. The fact that a majority of these systems exhibit dipping behavior suggests that 
that the outflowing gas is in the form 
of equatorial disk winds. Although the mechanism for the launch and acceleration of these winds is debated, it is very likely
that thermal driving at least contributes to the overall picture. Our previous radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of a fiducial X-ray binary indicate that thermal heating can drive significant outflows (with outflow mass from the outer parts of the disk exceeding the accretion rate onto the cenral black hole).
% It has been previously demonstrated that thermal winds are able to drive significant outflows (with outflow mass
%from outer parts of the disk exceeding the accretion rate in the inner disk required to explain the observed source
%luminosities. 
Here we use the same operator splitting method to carry out radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of a thermally driven 
disk wind for a range of source luminosities. We find that as the luminosity increases, the wind efficiency (the mass outflow
rate scaled to the assumed mass accretion rate) remains constant as a factor of about two. This is in agreement
with both observations and previous theoretical work. We also find that the maximum velocity seen in a simulated 
absorption line increases with luminosity.

\section{Introduction}
The signature of outflowing gas has been observed in a vast range of astrophysics objects, from protostellar
nebulae through cataclysmic variables and X-ray binaries up to Seyferts and Quasars. Whilst the 
radio loud jets are the most spectacular form of outflow, it is possible that the slower, yet more massive disk
winds may have more impact on the surroundings of the objects and have the ability to change the nature
of the accretion flow more substantially.
The driving mechanism for these disk winds is a topic of much debate and active research, however there are broadly
three contenders -- radiation driving, thermal driving, and magneto-centric driving.  Our interest here is in understanding the winds that appear as blue shifted X-ray absorption lines in X-ray binaries.

\todo[inline]{The above paragraph seems to refer to accretion disk systems in general, but what follows quickkly devolves to discussion of X-ray binaries.  Probably need either to indicate somehow that our specific interest is X-ray binaries. I've added something but it is not great. ksl}

Firstly, radiation driving of winds is simply caused by a transfer of momentum from radiation to matter via Compton
scattering or of scattering (mainly UV) radiation
from bound-bound lines in ionised material. If the ionisation state of the gas is 
favourable, then this latter line driving mechanism can
result in a driving force more than  1000 times that expected from Compton scattering alone \citep{1975ApJ...195..157C}.
 In X-ray binaries
the observed absorption lines suggest that the material tends to be highly ionised \citep[e.g.][]{2009ApJ...701..865K,
2018ApJ...861...26A}, with ionization parameter $\xi \geq 3$
\citep{2016AN....337..368D} and hence this mechanism is unlikely to be important. That said, the luminosity of 
some XRBs is 
approaching or even exceeding the Eddington limit, and so radiation driving via Compton scattering alone 
may be sufficient to affect the
flow.

Secondly, thermal driving is the case where gas is heated to a temperature at which the thermal velocity of the 
gas exceeds
the local escape velocity. In this case, mass-loss is inevitable and if the geometry is suitable (for example a
geometrically thin accretion disk) then a wind can be produced. This mechanism is particularly attractive in 
X-ray binaries, where the relatively high temperature of the radiation produced by the inner parts of a black-hole or 
neutron star accretion disk along with strong X-rays produced by the corona can produce gas temperatures in excess
of the escape velocity at reasonable radii. As a rule of thumb, thermal winds might be expected
to arise at or just inside the Compton Radius ($\rm{R_{IC}}$) - the radius at which gas at the Compton temperature ($T_C$ - 
the temperature at which the Compton heating and cooling rates balance)
for a given source SED has thermal velocity in excess of the escape velocity \citep{1983ApJ...271...70B}, defined as
\begin{equation}
R_{IC}=\frac{GM_{BH}\mu m_H}{k_BT_C}
\end{equation}
where $M_{BH}$ is the mass of the central object, $\mu$ is the 
mean molecular mass which we set to 0.6 and the other symbols have the usual meaning. 
For our SED, $T_C=1.4\times10^7$~K, so $R_{IC}=4.82\times10^{11}$ - about $4.6\times10^5$ gravitational
radii.


 The third proposed mechanism is that of magneto-centrifugal driving. 
Observations of the disk-wind in GRO J1655-40 in a peculiar `hypersoft' state suggested that the wind in that
case arose well inside $\rm{R_{IC}}$. In such a case the existence of a thermal wind is harder to justify 
and magneto-centrifugal driving has been suggested as an alternative driving mechanism
\citep[but also see \citealt{2006ApJ...652L.117N,2015MNRAS.451..475U,2016ApJ...823..159S}]
{1992ApJS...80..753S,2006Natur.441..953M,2008ApJ...680.1359M,2009ApJ...701..865K}. Since
magnetic fields are essential in the evolution of accretion disks, it is not unreasonable to expect such winds to 
exist. In such a wind, ionized material is loaded onto magnetic field lines leaving the accretion disk, and via a process
of angular momentum conservation, the material is accelerated as it moves out along the field lines, like beads
on a wire.

Most likely, all three mechanisms are at play perhaps changing their importance depending on the
geometry and accretion state of the source in question. Of the three mechanisms, thermal driving is 
particularly interesting because it is almost certain to 
operate on some level wherever there is strongly heated gas and a disk of sufficient radial extent that hot gas 
can escape. 

\todo[inline]{The next paragrah is very Higginbottom/Proga centric.  There are other people who have worked on this problem, and so some general references are needed.  This is important since one of these folks will likely be the referee.  It would be useful to identify who were the first few to suggest thermal driving, separate from any work we have done.}
Previous studies have shown that very large mass-loss rates
are possible through thermal winds  \citep{2015ApJ...807..107H} although this is very dependant on the details
 of the heating/cooling rates  \citep{2017ApJ...836...42H}. These 
in turn depend critically on the source SED and any attenuation effect between the source and the wind
launching region. \citet[hereafter H18]{2018MNRAS.479.3651H} presented a radiation-hydrodynamic simulation which 
took account
of this attenuation by coupling the radiative transfer code  \textsc{python} to the hydrodynamics code \textsc{zeus} and 
found that there was still an appreciable outflow, with about two and a half times as much material outflowing as was required
to produced the observed luminosity through accretion. In addition, reasonable agreement was found between 
Lyman $\alpha$ lines of helium and hydrogen like iron generated from the simulation and those seen in \emph{Chandra} 
observations of the LMXB GRO J1655-40 in the soft-intermediate state. 

That simulation was for a luminosity of 4 percent of the Eddington luminosity  ($\rm{L_{Edd}}$) for a 7 solar mass 
central black hole but disk winds have been observed in systems with luminosities up to or even slightly exceeding 
$\rm{L_{Edd}}$ \citep[][herafter P12]{2012MNRAS.422L..11P}.  Observations
suggest that the wind efficiency (mass loss rate divided by mass accretion rate) may increase with luminosity, 
(P12, although this relationship is driven by observations of a single exceptional source) whilst recent theoretical work 
suggests that the wind efficiency tends to a constant value \citep[][hereafter D18]{2018MNRAS.473..838D}.

Here, we extend the radiation hydrodynamic simulations to higher 
luminosities in order to investigate the effect on mass loss rate and velocity in the resulting outflows. 
As discussed in Section \ref{section:method}, we  use the same technique as H18 with slight modifications for varying the luminosity.
We then present our results in Section \ref{section:results} before making comparisons to observations in Section \ref{section:discussion}.


 

\section{Method }
\label{section:method}

As in H18, we use an operator splitting radiation-hydrodynamic method to treat the propagation of radiation
from a central source through the wind. We use the hydrodynamic code {\sc zeus} 
\citep[][extended by \citealt{2000ApJ...543..686P}]{1992ApJS...80..753S}, coupled to our own ionization and
 radiative transfer code {\sc python} \citep[][extended by \citealt{,2013MNRAS.436.1390H} and 
 \citealt{2015MNRAS.450.3331M}]{2002ApJ...579..725L}. 

Since thermal winds are expected to arise at or just inside $\rm{R_{IC}}$ which is independent of the source 
luminosity, we leave the simulation geometry unchanged
from H18, and simply increase the luminosity. We use the same logarithmic grid, the parameters of which are given in the upper
part of Table \ref{table:wind_param}. The mid-plane of the simulation space is set up with a constant 
density boundary condition, forming a mass reservoir for any resulting outflow. The value of this constant density
is important, since the wind is generated when the ionization parameter is at a critical value $\xi_{cool,max}$ which
represents the maximum ionization parameter for gas on the `cool branch' of the thermal stability curve. Gas with
$\xi<\xi_{cool,max}$ has a stable temperature of a few tens of thousands K where line/recombination cooling 
balances photoionization heating. 

As the 
ionization parameter increases past this value the gas becomes thermally unstable and heats up rapidly. 
This heating causes expansion and
a wind is driven. We refer to the part of the wind where this acceleration occurs as the acceleration zone.
In the optically thin limit one can set the mid-plane density so that gas at the mid-plane has
exactly the right ionization parameter. This means that the acceleration zone occurs in the cells directly 
above the mid-plane, avoiding including static material in the simulation, and thus maximizing the resolution in the acceleration zone.

In the simulations presented here attenuation of the radiation is treated fully and it is therefore not possible to 
compute the ionization parameter for a given cell a-priori since it depends not only on the local density  
but also on the density of the developing wind along the 
sightline back to the source. 
We therefore set the mid-plane density using the optically thin ionisation parameter,
finding that a small wedge of static material does form due to optical depth effects. However the extent of this does not significantly
affect the resolution in the acceleration zone. The mid-plane density, $\rho_0$ is given in Table
\ref{table:wind_param} and is proportional to the increasing luminosity, thereby preserving the same
ionization parameter (in the optically thin approximation).

All other aspects of the simulation are identical to that described by H18, including a truncation of the 
mid-plane density boundary condition at $\rm{R=2 R_{IC}}$.

\label{figure:wind_small_image}
\end{figure*}

We have computed disk-wind models for central source luminosity 
$\rm{L=0.1~L_{Edd}-1.0~L_{Edd}}$ in steps of $\rm{0.1~L_{Edd}}$. In each case, the simulations reach stable states, 
with static disk-like wedges forming at the base of the simulation as seen in H18. The reason for this
structure is attenuation of the radiation through the disk. So, if a cell at a given angle has just the right
conditions to launch a wind, the cell behind it will be slightly obscured and so on until at a certain radius
the radiation is attenuated to the point at which a wind is launched from the next theta cell 'up'. This gives
rise to a thin, slightly convex disk structure. 

Because we increase the mid-plane density in proportion to the luminosity in order to try and maintain 
a fixed ionization parameter at the base of the wind, the shape of the disk structure slightly changes as
the luminosity increases. In all cases, at the inner radial edge, the disk/wind interface occurs at 
around 89\degree~from the z-axis (i.e. 1\degree~ above the mid-plane). For the original $\rm{0.04L_{Edd}}$ 
simulation, the angle at which the interface occurs decreases to about 88\degree~ by the maximum radial
extent of the disk, whereas for the $\rm{L_{Edd}}$ simulation, the interface is about a degree further from the
midplane at 87\degree.

Density contour plots for some of the resulting outflows are shown in Figure \ref{figure:wind_small_image}.
We concentrate here, and in the rest of the results/discussion sections, on the calculations using luminosities
up to 60 per cent of $L_{Edd}$. This is because we do not treat radiation driving, a process
that would become increasingly important as the luminosity approaches $L_{Edd}$.
It is clear from these images that the velocity of the outflows increases with luminosity, as does the 
density in the wind. Some useful parameters showing this are given in the lower part of Table \ref{table:wind_param}.
As one would expect, the mass-loss rate through the outer boundary, which is essentially a function of these 
two parameters also increases with luminosity. We will discuss this further in Section \ref{section:discussion}


We have also computed some simulated absorption line profiles, which give more insight into the velocities 
in the wind.
Firstly, we show the Fe~\textsc{xxv} Lyman~$\rm{\alpha}$ transition at 1.85~{\AA} for a sightline 
of 80\degree in Figure \ref{figure:line25}. This is calculated using the same ray tracing technique as discussed 
by \cite{2015ApJ...807..107H}. The equivalent width (EW) is very similar for all the lines (because they are all 
saturated) at about 5-6~eV. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/80_degrees_fe25.eps}
\caption{Simulated line profile for the Fe~\textsc{xxv} Lyman~$\rm{\alpha}$
transition at 1.85~{\AA}, as viewed from $i = 80\degree$ for a range
of luminosities.}
\label{figure:line25}
\end{figure}

There are two interesting observations to be made from this plot. Firstly, the maximum velocity seen in 
the line increases with luminosity. Secondly, there is a notable difference between the line two lower luminosity 
profiles and the higher pair. All lines exhibit some absorption at about $+100kms^{-1}$, due to thermal 
broadening of absorption from stationary or slow moving material. However for the 4 per cent and 10 percent 
cases the feature is almost black at $0kms^{-1}$ indicating the presence of far more slow moving material than 
in the 30 and 60 per cent cases. An explanation for this can be seen in the expected nature of outflows as one 
increases luminosity. 

A useful way of categorising different classes of thermally driven winds was introduced 
by \cite[hereafter B83]{1983ApJ...271...70B}, and further developed by \cite[hereafter W96]{1996ApJ...461..767W}. The
diagram from B83 is reproduced in Figure  \ref{figure:regions}. The vertical axis is the luminosity of the central
source in units of the `critical luminosity' defined as
\begin{equation}
L_{crit}=0.03T_{C,8}^{-1/2}L_{Edd}
\label{L_crit}
\end{equation}
where $T_{C,8}$ is the Compton temperature in units of $10^8$~K,
whilst the horizontal axis is the radius on the disk where streamline arises normalised to the Compton radius. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/fig7.eps}
\caption{Regions of different wind solutions after \protect\cite{1983ApJ...271...70B}. The horizontal dashed 
lines represent the luminosity and disk extent of the simulations in H18
(lowest line) and those presented here}
\label{figure:regions}
\end{figure}

The different regions designate different types of outflow or static atmosphere, and are a consequence of
how quickly the plasma is heated. The regions in the lower half of the model exhibit slow heating 
whilst regions in the upper half show rapid heating to the Compton temperature. The regions on the
right hand side are where gas at the Compton temperature would be expected to escape, whilst on the 
left hand side the gas is gravitationally bound and so forms an atmosphere rather than a wind. 
In region C, the gas is not heated quickly enough to get to the Compton temperature and so the 
wind is expected to be slow.

B83 found that their model did not yield a clear dividing line between bound and unbound solutions 
at $\omega=R_{IC}$ and W96 found that a more reasonable location for this cutoff was $\omega=0.1 R_{IC}$.
Our 4 per cent simulation represents about $0.5 L_{crit}$ and is shown on Figure \ref{figure:regions} as the lowest 
horizontal dashed line. The 10 per cent simulation (next horizontal line up) has a luminosity just below $L_{crit}$ 
and one can therefore tentatively ascribe the difference in the line profile around 0 $kms^{-1}$ to the change from 
region D/C to region E/B with the gas being more impulsively heated at the higher luminosities and hence 
accelerating more quickly.

Another line commonly seen in XRB winds is the Lyman $\alpha$ resonance 
line of Fe~\textsc{xxvi} which is actually a doublet with components at
1.778~{\AA} and 1.783~{\AA}. The ray traced absorption profile for this 
feature is given as the fine lines in Figure \ref{figure:line26_smooth}. The absorption profile
as a function of velocity in each of the two lines is almost identical to that seen in the 
Fe \textsc{xxv} feature shown in Figure \ref{figure:line25} but these features
are slightly less
saturated and hence there is a range of EWs for the doublet, ranging from -8~eV for the 4\% $\rm{L_{Edd}}$
run to -16~eV for the 60\% luminosity. The run at the Eddington luminosity 
has an EW of almost 20eV, but this should be treated with caution because of the lack
of radiation driving in our simulation.

The current generation of X-ray spectrometers are unable to split this feature
into its components; for example the wavelength resolution of the \emph{Chandra}
HETG is 0.012\AA~ compared to the feature spacing of 0.005\AA. (\emph{Swift} XRT = 0.05\AA,
\emph{NuStar} = 0.06\AA)
 Therefore the feature is always observed as a single line. The heavy lines in Figure 
 \ref{figure:line26_smooth}
show the line pair smoothed by a Gaussian to reproduce the appearance of this line
through the \emph{Chandra} HETG. 


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/80_degrees_fe26_smooth.eps}
\caption{Simulated line profile for the Fe~\textsc{xxvi} Lyman~$\rm{\alpha}$

\label{figure:line26_smooth}
\end{figure}

\textcolor{red}{I'm unsure about what can we really say
here regarding the smoothed line profile. Clearly the line width is huge - I started out thinking I'd 
write here about how the 
huge width might mean we kind of see absorption at huge blue shifts (out to the thousands of km/s 
that is reported in some sources - but in reality presumably
observer would fit a Gaussian to this and get a blue shift of a hundred km/s ish w.r.t. to rest
wavelength they normally quote of 1.78\AA. Not sure that the evidence is here to ruffle feathers}

\section{Discussion}
\label{section:discussion}


\subsection{Mass-loss rates}

The mass-loss rates listed in Table \ref{table:wind_param} 
increases as the luminosity of the central source increases however it is interesting to compare
these rates with the assumed accretion rate required to generate the luminosity. When we do 
this we find that the mass-loss through the wind is always roughly double the accretion rate.
This `wind efficiency' relationship is similar to that found in the analysis carried out by \cite{2018MNRAS.473..838D}
who found that for a disk of our size ($R_{out}=2R_{IC}$) and a Compton temperature
very close to ours the wind efficiency peaked at just over two for a luminosity close to our lowest luminosity.
They then see the efficiency decrease slowly with increasing luminosity, 
always remaining above one. Our wind efficiencies are slightly larger than theirs, which is interesting since
we neglect any radiation driving effects, which they include via an approximate correction. 

The wind efficiency for a range of observed XRB winds is given by \cite{2012MNRAS.422L..11P} and
it is instructive to compare our results with these observations. Figure \ref{figure:mdot_vs_lum} shows 
this comparison, with the black symbols referring to the observations and the red stars showing the
results of these simulations. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/ponti.eps}
\caption{$\rm{\dot{M}_{wind}/\dot{M}_{acc}}$ vs. luminosity based upon figure 5 in \citet{2012MNRAS.422L..11P}. 
Black symbols are empirical values obtained from {\em Chandra} HETG data for several LMXBs. 
The symbols refer to the specific object each measurement refers to 
(triangles = H1743-322; circles = 4U~1640-47; squares = GRS~1915+105; diamonds = GRO~J1655-40). 
The red stars represent the results of the simulations presented here, and the dotted line
is at $\rm{\dot{M}_{wind}/\dot{M}_{acc}}$=2.0.}
\label{figure:mdot_vs_lum}
\end{figure}

At first sight, our prediction of a constant wind efficiency does not
agree well with the observations, which appear to suggest an increase of wind efficiency with
luminosity. However, the trend suggesting an increase in wind efficiency with luminosity is largely driven 
by observations of just one source - GRS 1915 +105.  This is an exceptional source, which has been 
accreting close to the Eddington limit since its discovery in 1992 \citep{1994ApJS...92..469C,

entering quiescence. It also exhibits unusual SEDs, not corresponding exactly to the normal high/soft,
low/hard spectral states \cite{2016ApJ...833..165Z}. This complex source requires more detailed
analysis and modelling which is beyond the scope of this study. Setting aside the observations of this
source, thew rest show reasonable consistency with wind efficiency around two over a significant 
range of luminosities, as seen in the simulations.

\subsection{Line Shape}
\textcolor{red}{Thinking of moving a chunk of stuff from the results here - in particular the blurb 
about the comaprison to the regions - seems more discussions than results. But should I leave
any of the line results in results??}

\todo[inline]{I tend to agree this discussion looks better here than in the results section}

\subsection{Effect of radiation driving}

As the luminosity increases, one should include the effects
of radiation pressure on the simulation. For such a relatively hard SED, 
the plasma above the disk will by largely ionized, and so electron
pressure would be the only radiation pressure one would expect. The 
effect can be though of as effectively a reduction in the inner radius
at which a wind is launched. \cite{2018MNRAS.473..838D} give this 
correction as
\begin{equation}
\overline{R}_{IC}\approx R_{IC}\left(1-\frac{L}{0.71L_{Edd}}\right)
\end{equation}
which means that the wind can be launched from all radii at a luminosity
of $0.71 L_{Edd}$. This in turn means that our mass loss rates will be a lower 
bound for luminosities approaching or exceeding this value. \textcolor{red}{I should 
quickly try and work out the mass loss per unit disk area - check this is more or less
constant over all radii - this would allow me to quantify the approximate extra mass loss
rate that I might see} We might also 
expect somewhat higher velocities in the outflow, due to the additional force.

\textcolor{red}{I'm thinking that I could include here some numbers extracted from python 
which give numbers for radiation force- I think it is logged and it would be an 
interesting first look at what we might expect in the future. Only if its easy though.
If not, I think this whole subsection can go}

\todo[inline]{Unless the effects of continuum driving are included in the Kinetic Luminosity discussion below, I think this should go after 4.4.  You can conclude here that one of our future goals is to do this properly with continuum driving included. ksl}

\subsection{Kinetic Luminosity}
Whilst the mass loss is of interest when considering how the wind could affect the 
accretion flow through the disk, it is also interesting to consider what (if any) effect the
wind could have on the surroundings. The kinetic energy carried by the wind is a
good measure of this, and so we calculate this via a simple summation around the outer
edge of the domain of mass loss rate x radial velocity.

\label{figure:ke_vs_lum}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{figure:ke_vs_lum} clearly shows a dramatic increase in the 'Kinetic
efficiency" of the wind up to about $0.5L_{Edd}$ at which point it seems to
reach an asymptotic value of $6\times10^{-5}$ meaning that the wind is 
capturing about 0.006 per cent of the luminosity of the central source and converting
it into kinetic energy.
\textcolor{red}{Is this a physically significant number? It is tempting to think one 
could compute some kind of geometrical interpretation - but the wind covers much
more than this tiny percentage of the sky as seen by the central source so there
is more to it. In some ways it is more fundamental than the mass loss rate, although
probably less important because clearly such small K.Es wont really do much damage
outside the system.}


\section{Summary }

Thermal driving is an attractive mechanism to explain the outflows observed in several 
X-ray binaries seen at high inclinations. We have previously demonstrated that 
the outflow seen in the soft-intermediate state of GRO J1655-40 could be plausibly 
modelled by a thermal wind, and here we extend that work to higher luminosities. We find

\begin{itemize}
\item{As the luminosity increases, so does the mass-loss rate through the wind. However, 
when one normalizes the mass-loss rate to the assumed accretion rate, the ratio tends to 
a constant value of around 2. This is in agreement with previous theoretical studies and 
also observations.}
\item{At the luminosity increases, the maximum blue shifted velocity seen in a simulated 
absorption line increases. There is also less material at low velocities as the material 
is more impulsively heated.}
\item{The kinetic energy transported by the wind also increases with luminosity however 
as with the mass loss rate, the ratio of kinetic energy to luminosity tends to a fixed value
of $6\times10^{-5}$.}

These simulations do not include the effects of radiation driving, which may become
important at higher luminosities. 



\end{itemize}
